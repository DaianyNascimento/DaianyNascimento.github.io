# DC Characters Matching Game
Use your super powers to make matches in this classic game.


## Description
This is a simple matching game where the player has to find the images that matches. The player needs to click on a card to flip it. Flip two cards with the same image they stay flipped,            otherwise they turn back over. The game ends when all matches are found or when all the tries are over.


## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
- the game has a 3x4 square format.
- all squares are clickable.
- each clicked square reveals an image.
- when two different images are revealed, they're hidden again.
- when two identical images are revealed, a match is found and they're hide on the screen.
- to win the game, all matches must be found.
- the game displays the amount of tries made.


## Backlog
- add amount of tries made.
- on gameover screen display total tries made and the best play (the one with less tries).
