# DC Characters Matching Game
Use your super powers to make matches in this classic game.


## Description
This is a simple matching game where the player has to find the images that matches. The player needs to click on a card to flip it. Flip two cards with the same image they stay flipped,            otherwise they turn back over. The game ends when all matches are found or when all the tries are over.
